        <p>This page is for my CIT 230 class.</p>
        <p>Although I've always had an obsession with all things creative, design was not always my path. A beloved mentor of mine introduced me to the world of graphic design and my life fell into place. I began working towards my BFA in Graphic Design and loved every minute of it.</p>
        <p>I believe that everything I make should be beautiful and <em>functional</em>.</p>
