   <h2>Design Principles</h2>
   <!-- ***********************************************
Each design principle needs three items:
1- The principle's name and the team member responsible for it.
2- An image (screenshot) of the mobile browser screen showing the design principle in use.
3- A discussion of how the design principle is exemplified in the picture. Be detailed but keep it to one paragraph!

   <h3>Proximity &mdash;

   <p>
    Proximity has grouped all of these elements together  as they are all under the heading "Family fun & sunny savings". Within the larger group, there are smaller groupings. For instance, we can tell that the heading "Get outdoors & play goes with the picture of the swing set, as well as the descriptive text below it since all three of these elements are in close proximity to one another. It is not confusing what text goes with which picture because there is enough space between the text blocks to keep them apart.

   <h3>Alignment &mdash;

   <p>
    Alignment is strongly used to organize the elements on this page. The images are horizontally aligned with the top of the items' descriptions. Although not all of the descriptive information pieces are close to one another, you can tell that they go together because of the invisible connection created by their vertical alignment. As you go down the page, all of the images are aligned and all of the text on the right is aligned. This makes it easy for the user to find what they are looking for since they don't have to readjust where their eyes go for each individual item.

   <h3>Repetition &mdash;

   <p>
    In this picture we can see few instances of repetition being used to attract the user's attention. The first is color. In this area pink is being used to group ideas for Mother Day gifts. They also use red text to emphasize deals. This draws your eyes to why you should be buying from target. Another thing that is being repeated is the idea of an image and then subtext that describes that image. Using repetition reduces unwanted surprises and helps the user navigate with an idea of what to expect.

   <h3>Contrast &mdash;

   <p>
    Of the major types of contrast that can be used to attract an audience’s attention, this website does a great job of using both light and dark as well as color. Unlike many websites, Target.com is a great example of an ideal navigation menu. As you can see in this picture, the menu consists of two parts - the main section in red and the footer section in white. I really like how they used red for the color of the main section for a few reasons, not the least of which being that it stands out! To contrast that, each of the different features on the main section of the menu are displayed in white, which allows for them to stand out as well. Also in contrast to that, the smaller, secondary section of the navigation menu is likewise in white, which helps it to complement the main section. Even though the items listed in this section aren’t as glaring as those of the main section, they are definitely still noticeable, as they appear as links when hovered over. This is important because if the different options that are offered at the top of the screen are hard to notice, they may end up getting missed altogether by those who surf the website.

   <h3>Typography &mdash;

   </h3>

   <p>
    As you can see in this photo, you can see that the typography is simple. The typeface is easy to read, and is spaced correctly to make all writing on the page easy to read. All writing is done in the same simple font, and text is limited to minimum necessary to convey meaning, making you feel like the website itself is simple and easy to use. Everything is centered, making it eye catching and seeming important, yet not having enough text to make it seem like too much. Text is colored to draw attention, and text that they don't want you to focus on has been made small and harder to read.
